My github account contins a repository with a project inside, that can hold and recall different versions and edits of the project. 
The repository I created is able to contian all of my project files and versions in history. 
To clone the repository, I downloaded Github on my comoputer, then signed in and linked it to my online account to clone the repository onto the hard drive.
